# wiivc_chan_booter  
When you are building a homebrew wii iso for use in a wiiu wii vc title, you can include this as a way to boot a installed wii channel.  
Include it as main.dol together with a "title.txt" (for wit in the "files" folder) that contains a title id (for example, WALP for art style light trax).  
When you then launch that wii vc title, it will boot that title id from the title.txt within a couple of seconds.
